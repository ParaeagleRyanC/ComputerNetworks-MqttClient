# MQTT Client

`MQTT` is a type of application layer protocol. It requires the following information:
* Hostname
* Port Number
* Client ID
* Topic
* Message
* Username and Password (optional)

Similar to the protocol of [TCP Client v1](https://github.com/ParaeagleRyanC/ComputerNetworks-TcpClientV1), an `ACTION` and `MESSAGE` is send to the server but in the format of:
```
CLIENT_ID/TOPIC/MESSAGE
```

This program demonstrates the knowledge of using `MQTT` and familiarity with asynchronous code.
